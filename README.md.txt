Introduction

Hello Team,

My name is Enest Dembedza and I am from Harare, Zimbabwe. I am excited to be a part of this team and to work with all of you.

Personal Information

I am married and have two wonderful kids. My family means everything to me,and I strive to make them happy every day.

Hobbies

In my free time, I enjoy outdoor activities, especially hiking and fishing. There is something so peaceful about being in nature, and I find it very rejuvenating. Hiking allows me to clear my mind and focus on the present moment. Fishing, on the other hand, is a great way to spend time with friends and family while also enjoying the outdoors.

Thank you for taking the time to read a little bit about me. I look forward to getting to know all of you and working together to achieve our goals.
